# Data-Mining-Na-ve-Bayes-Classifier
In this assignment, I was required to design a Naïve Bayes Classifier that classifies images to 26 classses,
which gives each class of images an alphabet character (A-Z).
The project contains two folders "Train" and "Test". The “Train” folder contains 7 images for each character (Total of 182 images),
while the “Test” folder contains 2 images for each character (Total 52 images).
Each Image is 12*12 pixels greyscale image. The images in the “Train” folder should be used to train a classifier for each character.
After the classifiers are trained, the images given in the “Test” folder test each classifier.
Also it is assumed each pixel is distributed according to a Gaussian distribution whose parameters are identified in the training phase
of the Naïve Bayes classifier.
